# ASAFARIM Multi-Fullstack Application Development Plan

## 1. Applications

### Docusaurus Techdocs Application

- **Setup:** Initialize a Docusaurus project for hosting technical documentation. Integrate the frontend with a PHP Laravel API to fetch and display documentation dynamically.
- **Backend Integration:** Ensure the Laravel backend serves documentation data appropriately, providing APIs for content management and updates.

### React and Angular Apps

- **React (TypeScript):** Start with Create React App using the TypeScript template. Implement Redux for state management if needed to manage complex state across components.
- **Angular (TypeScript):** Set up using Angular CLI. Consider using NgRx for state management in more complex scenarios. Focus on creating modular and reusable components.

## 2. Backend Development

### Node.js (JavaScript) and PHP (Laravel) APIs

#### Node.js Backend (for Techdocs)

- **Project Initialization:** Use Express.js framework. Establish a connection with MySQL using an ORM like Sequelize for database operations.
- **API Development:** Create RESTful APIs to manage documentation data, including CRUD operations.

#### Laravel Backend (for Authdash and other services)

- **Setup:** Set up a Laravel project, configuring it to interact with MySQL.
- **Authentication:** Implement user authentication using Laravelâ€™s built-in systems. Consider OAuth or JWT for session management and secure API access.

## 3. Database Setup

- **MySQL Configuration:** Set up `asafarimDB` for storing application data. Define schemas and relationships for user data (authdash) and documentation data (techdocs).

## 4. Server and Deployment

- **Server Configuration:** Configure the server at `asafarim.be` using Nginx or Apache. Set up reverse proxies to handle frontend and backend services.
- **Deployment Automation:** Use CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## 5. Architecture Considerations

- **Client-Server Model:** Initially maintain a monolithic structure with distinct frontend and backend services.
- **Microservices Architecture (Future):** Plan for a potential transition to microservices to enhance scalability and modularity.

## 6. Security and CORS

- **Security Measures:** Implement HTTPS for secure communication. Secure data at rest and in transit using encryption. Manage sensitive information using environment variables.
- **CORS Configuration:** Set up CORS policies to allow cross-origin requests from frontend applications, ensuring secure API access.

## 7. Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Utilize Jest for React and Mocha or Jest for Node.js. Angular testing can leverage Jasmine/Karma.
- **Integration Testing:** Create comprehensive test suites to validate the integration between different system components.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Use Testcafe to simulate real user interactions and ensure the application works as expected.

## 8. Documentation and Maintenance

- **Code Documentation:** Use JSDoc and PHPDoc to document JavaScript and PHP codebases, respectively.
- **User Documentation:** Leverage Docusaurus for creating detailed user guides and technical documentation, ensuring users and developers can easily understand the system.

## Next Steps

1. **Development Environment Setup:** Establish local development setups for all technologies, ensuring consistency across the team.
2. **Core Feature Development:** Focus on building and integrating essential features, with an emphasis on user authentication and basic functionality.
3. **Iterative Development:** Implement an iterative development cycle, continuously testing and deploying new features for stability and performance.
